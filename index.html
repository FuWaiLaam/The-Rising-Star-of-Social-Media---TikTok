          <h3>Webpage Aims</h3>
          <article>
            <h4>Our aim for this website is to explore the possibilities of social media (particularly TikTok), address the controversies and bring out solutions to potentially fix the arising problems occurring when people use this platform. It is hoped people can have a better understanding of social media platforms. With better knowledge of the platforms, people would have self-control and use social media platforms wisely and carefully, avoiding unnecessary problems that may occur from overusing social media apps. Social media platform corporates and countries should also pay attention to this bandwagon and attempt to regulate their policies to ensure the privacy and safety of citizens.</h4>

          <h2>Social Media Backstory and Usage</h2>
          <h3>What is social media?</h3>
          <article>
            According to Caleb & Rebecca (2014), social media are internet-based platforms that facilitate perceptions of communication among users, originating from user-generated types of content.
          </article>
          <h3>History of social media</h3>
          <article>
            <img src="images/timeline.jpeg" class="timeline">
            Digital communication originated in 1844. It was technically the first appearance of social media. The first electronic message was sent from Baltimore to Washington D.C. by Samuel Morse, an American inventor.
          <br>
          <br>
            However, most of the modern social media we currently understand were influenced by the creation of the internet in 1969. The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) of the USA was responsible for the outcomes of social media in the present day.
          <br>
          <br>
            Blogs were prevalent in the 1990s era of the internet. Since there are no third-party applications, users posted their content freely and received comments from others. This has led to the creation of social media.
          <br>
          <br>
            Social media truly started in 1997. The first appearance of a website named Six Degrees has made creating social media possible. It allowed users to use customized profiles and to communicate with other users.
          <br>
          <br>
            Many other platforms also emerged from the trend of people getting engaged in social media content. TikTok - a social media platform launched in 2016, became a viral sensation, especially for younger generations.

          <h3>Creation of TikTok</h3>
          <article>TikTok is launched by a Chinese technology company named ByteDance, known as Douyin in China. It has grown stratospherically since late 2017. The cause of TikTok’s popularity is that it allows users to send short videos that are 60 seconds or less.

          <h2>TikTok's Market</h2>
          <h3>Why is there a large amount of demand for TikTok?</h3>
          <article>
            Videos on TikTok are only a minute long. It is eye-catching and people do not need to pay much attention and time to it. Audiences are more likely to share short videos to their friends, online, etc.  It is also easier for content creators to create videos that are only a minute long as it takes less time to create videos on YouTube which needs a certain length of time to get benefits. Creators can save time and effort when creating videos on TikTok. Since videos on TikTok are only a minute long, some content creators post short comedy skits, some artists use the platform to promote their songs. They can post the chorus of the song and let other creators add the audio to their videos.

          <h3>Trend in TikTok</h3>

          <h2>News with the Controversies of TikTok</h2>
          <h3>TikTok “challenges”</h3>
          <article>
            “Challenges” is a famous activity on TikTok. For example, some users will upload a dancing practice and the other viewer will try to imitate his/her dance. It is one of the famous types of video on TikTok. However, some dangerous challenges on TikTok are imitated by TikTok daredevils. One example is the “blackout” challenge where the challengers should choke themselves until they pass out. 
            <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/12-old-girl-dies-doing-224154477.html" target="_blank">On 13 January in the city of Capitan Bermudez,</a> Argentina,
            a 12-year-old girl </a>died after she attempted this challenge which she saw on TikTok and imitated it.
            <br>
            It showed that some teenagers will imitate dangerous actions which post on TikTok. It raises concerns about children's safety.
          </article>
          <h3>“Guess Who” games</h3>
          <article>
            Another concern is that some videos on TikTok spread the cyberbullying trend among teenagers. One example is the TikTok game 
            <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/education/wa-schools-battling-new-tiktok-guess-who-cyberbullying-trend-c-7313692" target="_blank">“Guess Who”.</a>
            The “Guess Who” game invites viewers to upload a part of the body of their peers and their teachers to guess who they are. This is a kind of bullying between teenagers.
          </article>
          <h3>Unhygienic acts from teens</h3>
          <article>
            <iframe width="720" height="1280" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7rPu1L4hfk" title="Sushi conveyor belt pranks spark outrage in Japan" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="sushiro"></iframe>
            Moreover, some inappropriate behaviours spread on TikTok will be imitated by teenagers. One example is the 
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-64898111" target="_blank">licking movement.</a>
            A man in Japan licks a soy sauce bottle on Sushiro and takes this action as a video and posts it on TikTok. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After the spreading of this video, many teenagers in Japan imitate his action. For instance, a man put wasabi on another's dish and licked the presented chopsticks. This bad behaviour has become a trend in Japanese society. Many teenagers think this is a funny action and try to copy it for clout.  
          </article>
          <h3>Privacy concerns</h3>
          <article>
            Furthermore, privacy concern is another controversy on TikTok. 
            <a href="https://theconversation.com/tiktok-bans-what-the-evidence-says-about-security-and-privacy-concerns-200608" target="_blank">In 2022, the former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo </a>
            proposed that the China government may set TikTok as a “Trojan Horse” to collect the users' data on TikTok, including their email, telephone number, dates of birth, and home address. TikTok uses data miners to track users' activity, leaving no room for privacy protection.  It raises a concern about potential safety problems.

          <h3>Time management skills</h3>
          <article>
            <img src="images/screen time.jpeg" class="screentime"></img>
            TikTok is known for causing addiction. People can spend hours scrolling through their phones - leading to a waste of time. Functions such as “Screen Time” from iPhone or iPad can display the total time that you have spent on different applications. With this function, you can check how much time you have spent on social media apps and try to reduce the duration of time if it is absurdly high.
          </article>
          <h3>Parents should try to teach the usage of the Internet to children</h3>
          <article>
            With our current technological advancements, many children can get access to the Internet as soon as they can touch a screen. It is the responsibility of parents to set up screen limitations for younger children to prevent them from seeing potentially harmful content on social media, or different platforms.
          </article>
          <h3>Educate yourselves about social media</h3>
          <article>
            It is fairly easy to get views and likes by just following trends from videos for clout. However, some trends as we have mentioned above may be harmful mentally and physically. According to the Cambridge University dictionary, common sense means the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way. Before following a trend, ask yourself if it is morally correct to do so, as those trends may only boost your popularity for a bit. Trends get irrelevant in a quick time and be replaced with new ones. It is of utmost importance for users to use common sense when they look at trends from social media, preventing themselves from getting into trouble or harming others.
          </article>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <article>
            There are mixed arguments for and against using TikTok. While it can help content creators to gain views or even earn revenue in an easier way, however, many low-quality or malicious content has also emerged from this platform. It is up to the user’s decision to use it wisely and correctly without hurting others and use it to promote positive content. Privacy and safety concerns are other issues that need to be covered. Some countries may take to the extreme to ban the usage of TikTok entirely because of privacy issues, and it is suggested that TikTok should have more concurrent policies to address the concerns coming from different backgrounds. Therefore, it results in people acknowledging the policies of the platform.
